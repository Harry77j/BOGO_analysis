## üìÅ Repository Contents

* **`/code/`**: Contains all scripts (e.g., R, Python) for data processing, statistical analysis, and figure generation.
    * `BOGO_screening.ipynb` (Screening for figure 1, 2, 4)
    * `BOGO_scRNA.ipynb` (Screening for figure 3)

* **`/ORFeome_reference/`**: Contains the FASTA or other format file for the ORFeome reference used for alignment and quantification.
    * `9'1_delta_final.fa`: The FASTA reference file for the ORFeome-seq alignment.

* **`/environments/`**: Contains files to reproduce the computational environment.
    * `BOGO.yml`: The YAML file to reproduce the Conda environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Requirements

The analysis pipeline requires **Anaconda** and is run within a **Conda environment**

### Software Dependencies
To reproduce the analysis environment, you can use the provided environment file:

```bash
# Navigate to the environment folder
cd environments/

# Create the environment named 'pipeline'
conda env create -f BOGO.yml

# Activate the new environment
conda activate pipeline
